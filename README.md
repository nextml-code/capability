## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to prove our capability to deliver machine learning solutions. We will keep it short and to the point.

### Simplicity
Simple solutions are usually good and "cool" tricks redundant. We don't want to "impress" by making our projects seem more complicated than they are. Instead, we want to describe our method, how we approach the problem, and the solution. We can't share the entire codebases of our projects, but we can and will share relevant code-snippets.
