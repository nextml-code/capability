## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to prove our capability to deliver machine learning solutions. We will keep it short and to the point.

### Simplicity
Simple solutions are usually good and "cool" tricks are often redundant. 


### Sharing Code
We can't share the entire codebases of our projects, because of ownership reasons. But we can and will share relevant code-snippets.
