# Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to prove our capability to deliver machine learning solutions. It's short and to the point.

### Simplicity
Simple solutions are usually good and "cool" tricks redundant. The goal is to show you that we are professionals who deliver value. We don't want to "impress" by making our projects seem more complicated than they are.

### Cutting Edge
With that said, we still want to prove that we have the skills (both in machine learning and programming) to develop and implement cutting-edge algorithms. 

### Sharing code
We can't share the entire codebases of our projects, but we can and will share relevant code-snippets.

### Content
Below, you can read short summaries about some of our projects, products, and spare-time experiments. We will describe how we approached the problem, what we tested, and the solution.

# Projects

### Detecting Clamps

- Speed
- Unbalanced dataset => required sampleling, first same of all class, and then in that stream we sampled by loss.
  Most images that didn't contain anything was uninteresting, but 

- Interesting architecture with multiple outputs
- Customized evaluation

Multiple cameras

*Tested*
- Mixup
- 


- Image inpainting for p anomalies. 
- Variational auto encoder to find anomalies
- Using latent representation to cluster anomalies to see if we can find similar clusters

### Object Tracking

- 
- (Tracking) Correlation filters, fourier transform in 2d => complex conjugate

state of the art for object tracking using correlation filters to follow objects across frames. 


### Audio Denoising

- Generated data by combining podcasts with noise
- STFT to convert to spectogram
- Unet with Efficient net to create a mask
- multiplty mask with spectogram
-
